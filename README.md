# CRUD System

A simple **Employee Management System** built in C that provides CRUD functionality using a menu-driven interface. The project allows the user to create, display, modify, and delete employee records, with key navigation options implemented for smooth interaction.

## Features
- **Add Employee Records**: Enter new employee details into the system.
- **Display Employee Records**: View all existing employee data.
- **Modify Employee Records**: Update information for specific employees.
- **Delete Employee Records**: Remove employee data from the system.
- **Exit Program**: Safely exit the program.
- **Navigation**:
  - Use `UP` and `DOWN` keys to navigate the menu.
  - Use `ENTER` to select an option.
  - USE `BACKSPACE` to return to the main menu
  - Use `ESC` to exit at any time.
  - Use `HOME` to go to the New option in main menu.
  - Use `END` to go to the Exit option in main menu. 


### Core Functionalities:
- **Navigation with flags**: The `flag` variable determines the current state of the menu, making it easy to manage transitions.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures correct user inputs are processed, and invalid inputs are handled gracefully.
- **Switch Case for Menu Control**: A structured approach to handle menu navigation and operations.
